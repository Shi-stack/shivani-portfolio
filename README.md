# Final Project-Presentation
### Created by Shivani Patel

#### I have made two websites for my final presentation.

1. ***Portfolio Website:*** 

- In my portfolio website I have used some animation on my first page.

- Link for my portfolio [Shivani's Portfolio]()
- Made Hamburger menu with JS. 

- Used little bit of SAAS CSS , created a common colors and font family which I carried in my project.

- The images which I have used are uniques because I got the images from Womens in Web Dev community.They have their facebook and instagram family. 

- Last but not the least I have connected all the links in footer. I dont want to make a contact form instead I have given my email once you clicked it will direct to my email, so anybody can contact me.

-  I have connected the links for all my works which I am proud of. Its shows that how I develop from no stack to jr.stack. 

2. ***My Business Website:***

- I have made a wordpress website for my own business name Roshiv Tech.Inc 

- Link for my business website [RoshivTech.Inc](https://roshivtech.com/)

- As we are the startup company you may not find each and every services which generally the website business does.

- We are more focused for startup and for non-profit organozations.

- I have a custom logo for this website which is a symbol of team work.

- Used video in homepage which not only engage the customer but it will also give clue to the web technology who are not aware of it.

- Then in next page ABout us page all explain how we work how we started and who our team is.

- In solutions we have highlighted all the services which we can provide.

-Portfolio contains some of our past work which we have done for our clients. 

- Get started form will show our address and contact forms.
